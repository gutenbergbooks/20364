<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>TOM MOORE'S FIRST!</h3>

  <p>It is now generally understood that the first poetic effusion of
  Thomas Moore was entrusted to a publication entitled <i>Anthologia
  Hibernica</i>, which held its monthly existence from Jan. 1793 to
  December 1794, and is now a repertorium of the spirited efforts made in
  Ireland in that day to establish periodical literature. The set is
  complete in four volumes: and being anxious to see if I could trace the
  "fine Roman" hand of him whom his noble poetic satirist, and after fast
  friend, Byron, styled the "young Catullus of his day," I went to the
  volumes, and give you the result.</p>

  <p>No trace of Moore appears in the volume containing the first six
  months of the publication; but in the "List of Subscribers" in the
  second, we see "<i>Master</i> Thomas Moore;" and as we find this
  designation changed in the fourth volume to "<i>Mr.</i> Thomas Moore,
  Trinity College, Dublin!" (a boy with a black ribband in his collar,
  being as a collegian an "<i>ex officio</i> man!"), we may take it for
  ascertained that we have arrived at the well-spring of those effusions
  which have since flowed in such sparkling volumes among the poetry of the
  day.</p>

  <p>Moore's first contribution is easily identified; for it is prefaced by
  a note, dated "Aungier Street, Sept. 11, 1793," which contains the usual
  request of insertion for "<i>the attempts of a youthful muse</i>,"
  &amp;c., and is signed in the semi-incognito style, "Th-m-s M&mdash;re;"
  the writer fearing, doubtless, lest his fond mamma should fail to
  recognise in <i>his own copy</i> of the periodical the performance of her
  little precocious Apollo.</p>

  <p>This contribution consists of two pieces, of which we have room but
  for the first: which is a striking exemplification (in subject at least)
  of Wordsworth's aphorism, that "the child is father to the man." It is a
  sonnet addressed to "Zelia," "<i>On her charging the author with writing
  too much on Love!</i>" Who <i>Zelia</i> was&mdash;whether a lineal
  ancestress of Dickens's "Mrs. Harris," or some actual grown up young
  lady, who was teased by, and tried to check the chirpings of the little
  <!-- Page 566 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page566"></a>{566}</span>
  precocious singing bird&mdash;does not appear: but we suspect the former,
  for this sonnet is immediately followed by "A Pastoral Ballad!" calling
  upon some <i>Celia</i> unknown to "pity his tears and complaint,"
  &amp;c., in the usual namby-pamby style of these compositions. To any one
  who considers the smart, <i>espiègle</i>, highly artificial style of "Tom
  Moore's" after compositions, his "Pastoral Ballad" will be what Coleridge
  called his Vision, a "psychological curiosity."</p>

  <p>Passing on through the volumes, in the Number for February 1794 we
  find a paraphrase of the Fifth Ode of Anacreon, by "Thomas Moore;"
  another short poem in June 1794, "To the Memory of Francis Perry, Esq.,"
  signed "T.&nbsp;M.," and dated "Aungier Street." These are all which can be
  identified by outward and visible signs, without danger of mistake: but
  there are a number of others scattered through the volumes which I
  conjecture may be his; they are under different signatures, generally
  T.&nbsp;L., which may be taken to stand for the <i>alias</i> "Thomas Little,"
  by which Moore afterwards made himself so well known. There is an "Ode to
  Morning," in the Number for March 1794, above the ordinary run of
  magazine poetry. And in the Number for May following are "Imitations from
  the Greek" and Italian, all under this same signature. And this last
  being derived from some words in Petrarch's will, bequeathing his lute to
  a friend, is the more curious; and may the more probably be supposed
  Moore's, as it contains a thought which is not unlikely to have suggested
  in after years the idea of his celebrated melody, entitled the "Bard's
  Legacy." The Number for Nov. 1794, last but one in the fourth volume,
  contains a little piece on "Variety," which independent of a T.&nbsp;M.
  signature, I would <i>almost swear</i>, from internal evidence, to be
  Moore's; it is the last in the series, and indicates such progress as two
  years might be supposed to give the youthful poet, from the
  lack-a-daisical style of his first attempts, towards that light,
  brilliant, sportive vein of humour in which he afterwards wrote "What the
  Bee is to the Flowret," &amp;c., and other similar compositions. I now
  give Moore's first sonnet, including its footnote, reminding us of the
  child's usual explanatory addition to his first drawing of some amorphous
  animal&mdash;"This is a horse!" or "a bear!" as the case may be. Neither
  the <i>metre</i> nor the <i>matter</i> would prepare us for the height to
  which the writer afterwards scaled "the mountain's height of
  Parnassus:"</p>

  "disjecta membra poetæ."</p>

<h3>NOTES ON SEVERAL MISUNDERSTOOD WORDS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> p. 544.)</p>

  <p>Let no one say that a tithe of these instances would have sufficed.
  Whoever thinks so, little understands the vitality of error. Most things
  die when the brains are out: error has no brains, though it has more
  heads than the hydra. Who could have believed it possible that after
  Steevens's heaped-up proofs in support of the authentic reading,
  "<i>carded</i> his state" (<i>King Henry IV.</i>, Act III. Scene 2.),
  Warburton's corruption, <i>'scarded</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>discarded</i>, was
  again to be foisted into the text on the authority of some nameless and
  apocryphal commentator? Let me be pardoned if I prefer Shakspeare's
  genuine text, backed by the masterly illustrations of his ablest
  glossarist, before the wishy-washy adulterations of Nobody: and as a
  small contribution to his abundant avouchment of the original reading,
  the underwritten passage may be flung in, by way of make-weight:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">"<i>Carded</i> his state (says King Henry),</p>
      <p><i>Mingled</i> his royaltie with carping fooles."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Since which it hath been and is his daily practice, either to broach
  doctrinas novas et peregrinas, new imaginations never heard of before, or
  to revive the old and new dress them. And these&mdash;for that by
  themselves they will not utter&mdash;<i>to mingle and to card</i> with
  the Apostles' doctrine, &amp;c., that at the least yet he may so vent

  the Parish Church of St. Giles, Cripplegate, on the Ninth of January,

<hr class="short" >

  <p><i>Trash</i>, to shred or lop.&mdash;So said Steevens, alleging that
  he had met with it in books containing directions for gardeners,
  published in the time of <!-- Page 567 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page567"></a>{567}</span> Queen Elizabeth. I fear his memory
  deceived him, or why should a man of his sound learning afterwards
  incline to vail bonnet to the dogmatist Warburton? whose knowledge of
  dogs, by the way, must have been marvellously small, or he could never
  have imagined them to overtop one another in a horizontal course.
  <i>Overrun</i>, <i>overshoot</i>, <i>overslip</i>, are terms in hunting,
  <i>overtop</i> never; except perchance in the vocabulary of the wild
  huntsman of the Alps. <i>Trash</i> occurs as a verb in the sense above
  given, Act I. Sc. 2. of the <i>Tempest</i>: "Who t'aduance, and who to
  <i>trash</i> for over-topping." I have never met with the <i>verb</i> in
  that sense elsewhere, but overtop is evermore the appropriate term in
  arboriculture. To quote examples of that is needless. Of it
  metaphorically applied, just as in Shakspeare, take the following
  example:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Of those three estates, which swayeth most, that in a manner doth
  overtop the rest, and like a foregrown member depriveth the other of
  their proportion of growth."&mdash;Andrewes' Sermons, vol. v. p. 177.,
  <i>Lib. Ang.-Cath. Theol.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Have we not the substantive <i>trash</i> in the sense of shreddings,
  at p. 542. book iii. of a <i>Discourse of Forest Trees</i>, by John
  Evelyn? The extract that contains the word is this:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Faggots to be every stick of three feet in length, excepting only one
  stick of one foot long, to harden and wedge the binding of it; this to
  prevent the abuse, too much practised, of filling the middle part and
  ends with <i>trash</i> and short sticks, which had been omitted in the
  former statute."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Possibly some of the statutes referred to by Evelyn may contain
  examples of the verb. In the meantime it will not be impertinent to
  remark, that what appears to be nothing more than a dialectic variety of
  the word, namely <i>trouse</i>, is of every-day use in this county of
  Hereford for trimmings of hedges; that it is given by Grose as a verb in
  use in Warwickshire for trimming off the superfluous branches; and
  lastly, that it is employed as a substantive to signify shreddings by
  Philemon Holland, who, if I rightly remember, was many years head master
  of Coventry Grammar School:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Prouided alwaies, that they be paued beneath with stone; and for want
  thereof, laid with green willow bastons, and for default of them, with
  vine cuttings, or such <i>trousse</i>, so that they lie halfe a foot
  thicke."&mdash;The Seuenteenth Booke of Plinie's <i>Naturall History</i>,
  chap. xi. p. 513.: London, 1634.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Trash</i> no one denies to be a kennel term for hampering a dog,
  but it does not presently follow that the word bore no other
  signification; indeed, there is no more fruitful mother of confusion than
  homonomy.</p>

  this change, whom the severe discipline of many years' study, and the
  daily access of accumulating knowledge, have schooled into a wholesome
  sense of their extreme fallibility in such matters. Without adding any
  comment, I now quote, for the inspection of learned and unlearned, the

  <p>After so many Notes, one Query. In the second folio edition of
  Shakspeare (my first folio wants the whole play), I find in
  <i>Cymbeline</i>, Act V. Sc. 3., the next beautiful passage:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Post.</i> Still going? This is a lord: Oh noble misery</p>
      <p>To be ith' field, and aske what newes of me:</p>
      <p>To-day how many would have given their honors</p>
      <p>To have sav'd their carkasses? Tooke heele to doo't,</p>
      <p>And yet dyed too. I in mine owne woe charm'd,</p>
      <p>Could not find death, where I did heare him groane,</p>
      <p>Nor feele him where he strooke. Being an ugly monster,</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,</p>
      <p>Sweet words; or hath moe ministers then we</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the antepenultimate line, Britaine was more than a century ago
  changed by Hanmer into Roman, therefore retained by Warburton, again
  rejected by Steevens and Johnson, once more replaced by Knight and
  Collier, with one of his usual happy notes by the former of the two,
  without comment by the latter, finally left unnoticed by Dyce. My Query
  then is this. What amount of obtuseness will disqualify a criticaster who
  itches to be tinkering and cobbling the noblest passages of thought that
  ever issued from mortal brain, while at the same time he stumbles and
  bungles in sentences of that simplicity and grammatical clearness, as not
  to tax the powers of a third-form schoolboy to explain?<a

<h3>VERNEY PAPERS&mdash;THE CAPUCHIN FRIARS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>In the appendix to <i>Notes of Proceedings in the Long Parliament</i>,
  by Sir Ralph Verney, edited by Mr. Bruce for the Camden Society in 1845,
  are "Notes written in a Cipher," which Mr. Bruce gives in the hope that
  the ingenuity of some reader will discover their meaning. I venture thus
  to decypher the same:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The Capuchin's house to be dissolued.</p>
      <p>No extracts of letters to be aloued in this house.</p>

      <p>A similitude of a depilat.</p>
      <p>Consciences corrupted."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I ought to state that in one or two instances the wrong cypher has
  evidently been used by mistake, and this has of course increased the
  difficulty of decyphering the notes.</p>

  <p>With reference to the note "The Capuchins' House to be dissolued," may
  I be allowed to refer to the following votes in the House of Commons, of
  the date 26th February, 1641-2:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ordered, That Mr. Peard, Mr. Whistler, Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Pideaux, Mr.
  Selden, Mr. Young, Mr. Hill, do presently withdraw, to peruse the
  statutes now in force against priests and Jesuits.</p>

  <p>"Ordered, That Mr. Whittacre, Mr. Morley, do presently go to Denmarke
  House.</p>

  <p>"Resolved, That the Capuchines shall be forthwith apprehended and
  taken into safe custody by the Serjeant-at-Arms attending on this house;
  and there kept till this house take farther order."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Capuchins were under the protection of the Queen Henrietta Maria;
  Denmark House was the name by which Somerset House was at the period
  known.</p>

  <p>Under date 2nd March, 1641-2, are the following entries in the
  Commons' Journal:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Mr. Holles brings this answer from the French Ambassador, That the
  Capuchins being sent hither by Articles of Treaty between the Two Crowns,
  he durst not of himself send them without Order from the King his Master,
  or the King and Queen here: And said farther, That the Queen had left an
  express Command for their stay here; and that he would be ever ready to
  do any good Office for this House, and to keep a good Correspondency
  between the Two Crowns; and if this House pleased, he would undertake to
  keep them safe Prisoners at Somersett House; and that the chapel there
  shall have the doors locked, and no Mass be said there.</p>

  <p>"Ordered, That Mr. Hollis do acquaint the French Ambassador, that this
  House doth accept of his Offer in securing the Persons of the Capuchins,
  till this House take farther Order: and that the Doors be locked, and
  made fast, at the Chapel at Somersett House; and that no Mass be said
  there.</p>

  <p>"Ordered, That the Lord Cramborne and Mr. Hollis shall acquaint the
  French Ambassador with the desires of this House, that the Capuchins be
  forthwith sent away; and to know if he will undertake to send them away;
  and, if he will, that then they be forthwith delivered unto him.</p>

  <p>"That Mr. Hollis do go up to the Lords, to acquaint them with the
  Resolutions of this House, concerning the Capuchins, and desire their
  Lordships' concurrence therein."</p>

<h3>EARLY SATIRICAL POEM.</h3>

  <p>On the turning over the pages of an old printed copy of Durand's
  <i>Rationale Divinorum Officiorus</i>, edited by Bonetus de locatellis
  bergomensis, and printed at Lyons in 1506, by Natalis Brabam, for Jaques
  Huguetan, I found the following copy of verses written on the fly-leaf.
  They are written in a hand which I am inclined to assign to a date <!--
  Page 569 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page569"></a>{569}</span> not
  much later than that of the book. There is no clue to the author. If they
  are thought worthy of insertion in "N. &amp; Q.," I beg to inquire,
  through the medium of your columns, whether they are to be found in any
  collection of early English poems? and whether the author is known?</p>

  <p>The ungallant sentiment of the first three stanzas is obvious. The
  fourth is not so plain; nor is its connexion with the others evident,
  though it is written without anything to mark separation; and the word
  "finis" is placed below it, as if to apply to the whole. I should be
  obliged if some one of your readers would give some explanation of
  it.</p>

<h3>THE LETTERS OF ATTICUS.</h3>

  <p>The editor of the <i>Grenville Papers</i> has alluded to some "very
  judicious and pertinent remarks in the 'N. &amp; Q.'" respecting the
  Letters of Atticus, and as most of your readers will probably agree with
  him that the authenticity of these letters is "a curious and interesting
  question, and one that deserves <i>very particular attention</i>," I beg
  to correct an error into which he and others have fallen, as to the date
  when Junius ceased to write under the signature Atticus. The Atticus
  forwarded by Junius to George Grenville on the 19th October, 1768, was,
  there is every reason to believe, the <i>last</i> from the pen of that
  writer, who was then preparing to come before the public in a more
  prominent character. When another correspondent adopted the signature
  Atticus, Woodfall gave his readers warning by inserting the following
  notice into the <i>Public Advertiser</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The Address to the Freeholders of the county of Middlesex, signed
  <i>Atticus</i>, in our next. The Printer thinks it his duty to acquaint
  his readers that this letter is not by the same hand as some letters in
  this paper a little time since, under the signature
  <i>Atticus</i>."&mdash;<i>Pub. Ad.</i>, March 19, 1769.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The printer took the like course when writers attempted to "impose
  upon the public" by using the signatures Lucius and C., and then freely
  inserted their letters; but when the same trick was tried with Junius,
  the printer did not scruple to alter the signature, or reject the
  contribution as spurious.</p>

  <p>The genuine Letters of Atticus have had a narrow escape lately of
  being laughed out of their celebrity by writers in some of our most
  respectable periodicals. The authenticity of these letters up to the 19th
  October, 1768, is now fully established. The undecided question of the
  authorship of Junius requires that every statement should be carefully
  examined, and (as far as possible) only well-authenticated facts be
  admitted as evidence in future.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Irish Bishops as English Suffragans.</i>&mdash;In compliance with
  the suggestion of J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;D. in your last volume, p. 385., I abridge from
  <i>The Record</i> of March 17th the following particulars:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"At a recent meeting of the Archæolgical Society the Rev. W. Gunner
  stated that from a research among the archives of the bishops and of the
  college of Winchester, he had found that many Irish bishops, during the
  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, were merely titular bishops, bearing
  the titles of sees in Ireland, while they acted as suffragans to bishops
  in England. A Bishop of Achonry, for instance, appeared to have been
  frequently deputed by William of Wykeham to consecrate churches, and to
  perform other episcopal duties, in his diocese; and the Bishops of
  Achonry seemed frequently to have been suffragans of those of Winchester.
  No see exhibits more instances of this expatriation than Dromore, lying
  as it did in an unsettled and tumultuous country. Richard Messing, who
  succeeded to Dromore bishopric in 1408, was suffragan to the Archbishop
  of York; and so died at <!-- Page 570 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page570"></a>{570}</span> York within a year after his appointment.
  His successor John became a suffragan to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
  and died such in 1420. Thomas Scrope, a divine from Leicestershire, was
  appointed by the Pope to this see in 1430: he could not live in peace
  with the Irish, and therefore became vicar-general to the Bishop of
  Norwich. Thomas Radcliffe, his successor, never lived in Ireland: 'the
  profits of his see did not extend to 30<i>l.</i> sterling, and for its
  extreme poverty it is void and desolate, and almost extincted, in so much
  as none will own the same, or abide therein.' Dr. Radcliffe was therefore
  obliged to become a suffragan to the Bishop of Durham. William, who
  followed him in the Dromore succession in 1500, lived in York, and was
  suffragan to its archbishop; and it would seem his successors were also
  suffragans in England, until the plantation of Ulster improved the
  circumstances of that province."</p>

  <p><i>Scarce MSS. in the British Museum.</i>&mdash;In Cotton MSS., Titus,

  "Cromwell's Remembrances." These comprise:</p>

  <p>1. A period from about the death of Anne Boleyn to his attainder.</p>

  <p>2. They are very miscellaneous, consisting of memoranda of subjects
  for conference with the king. Notices of persons to be remembered for
  offices. Sale of lands. Diplomacy, and various other particulars. Notes
  relative to the dissolution of monasteries; their riches, revenues, and
  pensions to abbots, &amp;c. The reception of Anne Cleves, and the
  alteration of the royal household thereupon. Privy council and
  parliamentary notes. Foreign alliances. Scotch and Irish affairs,
  consequent on the dissolution of abbeys, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>These curious materials for history are in the rough and confused
  state in which they were left by their author, and, to render them
  available, would require an index to the whole.</p>

  <p>The "Remembrances" are in some degree illustrated by Harl. MS. 604.,
  which is a very curious volume of monastic affairs at the dissolution.
  Also by 605, 606, and 607. The last two belong to the reign of Philip and
  Mary, and contain an official account of the lands sold by them belonging
  to the crown in the third and fourth years of their reign.</p>

  <p><i>The Royal Garden at Holyrood Palace.</i>&mdash;I cannot help

  There is, adjoining the Palace of Holyrood, an ancient garden of the old
  kings of Scotland: in it is a curious sundial, with Queen Mary's name on
  it. There is a pear-tree planted by her hands, and there are many other
  deeply interesting traces of the royal race, who little dreamed how their
  old stately places were to be profaned, after they themselves were laid
  in the dust. The garden of the Royal Stuarts is now <i>let</i> to a
  market gardener! Are there no true-hearted Scotchmen left, who will
  redeem it from such desecration?</p>

  having to bear them in lozenges? Formerly, all ladies of rank bore
  shields upon their seals, <i>e.g.</i> the seal of Margaret, Countess of
  Norfolk, who deceased <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1399; and of Margaret,
  Countess of Richmond, and mother of Henry VIII., who deceased <span
  class="sc">A.D.</span> 1509. These shields are figured in the <i>Glossary
  of Heraldry</i>, pp. 285, 286.</p>

  <p>2. Is it, heraldically speaking, wrong to inscribe the motto upon a
  circle (not a garter) or ribbon round the shield? So says the
  <i>Glossary</i>, p. 227. If wrong, on what principle?</p>

  <p>3. Was it ever the custom in this country, as on the Continent to this
  day, for ecclesiastics to bear their arms in a circular or oval
  panel?&mdash;the martial form of the shield being considered inconsistent
  with their spiritual character. If so, when did the custom commence, and

<h3>BISHOP BUTLER.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 528.)</p>

  <p>"Charity thinketh no evil;" but we must feel both surprise and regret
  that any one should, in 1853, consider it a doubtful question whether
  Bishop Butler died in the communion of the Church of England. The bishop
  has now been in his grave more than a hundred years; but Warburton says
  truly, "How light a matter very often subjects the best-established
  characters to the suspicions of posterity&mdash;how ready is a remote age
  to catch at a low revived slander, which the times that brought it forth
  saw despised and forgotten almost in its birth."</p>

  <p>X. Y. Z. says he would be glad to have this charge (originally brought
  forward in 1767) <i>sifted</i>. He will find that it has been sifted, and
  in the most full and satisfactory manner, by persons of no less
  distinction than Archbishop Secker and Bishop Halifax. The strong
  language employed by the archbishop, when refuting what he terms <!--
  Page 573 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page573"></a>{573}</span> a
  "gross and scandalous falsehood," and when asserting the bishops
  "abhorrence of popery," need not here be quoted, as "N.&amp; Q." is not
  the most proper channel for the discussion of theological subjects; but
  it is alleged that every man of sense and candour was convinced <i>at the
  time</i> that the charge should be retracted; and it must be a
  satisfaction to your correspondent to know, that as Bishop Butler lived
  so he <i>died</i>, in full communion with that Church, which he adorned
  equally by his matchless writings, sanctity of manners, and spotless
  life.<a name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote4"></a><b>Footnote 4:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag4">(return)</a>
  <p>Your correspondent may be referred to <i>Memoirs of the Life of Bishop
  Butler</i>, by a connexion of his own, the Rev. Thomas Bartlett, A.M.,
  published in 1839; and to a review of the same work in the <i>Quarterly
  Review</i>, vol. lxiv. p. 331.</p>

</div>
  <p>In reference to the Query by X.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Z., as to whether Bishop Butler
  died in the Roman Catholic communion, allow me to refer your
  correspondent to the contents of the letters from Dr. Forster and Bishop
  Benson to Secker, then Bishop of Oxford, concerning the last illness and
  death of the prelate in question, deposited at Lambeth amongst the
  private MSS. of Archbishop Seeker, "as negative arguments against the
  calumny of his dying a Papist."</p>

  <p>Than the allegations that Butler died with a Roman Catholic book of
  devotion in his hand, and that the last person in whose company he was
  seen was a priest of that persuasion, nothing can be more unreasonable,
  if at least it be meant to deduce from these unproved statements that the
  bishop agreed with the one and held communion with the other. Dr.
  Forster, his chaplain, was with him at his death, which happened about 11
  <span class="sc">a.m.</span>, June 16; and this witness observes (in a
  letter to the Bishop of Oxford, June 18) that "the last four-and-twenty
  hours preceding which [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> his death] were divided between short
  broken slumbers, and intervals of a calm but disordered talk when awake."
  Again (letter to Ditto, June 17), Forster says that Bishop Butler, "when,
  for a day or two before his death, he had in a great measure lost the use
  of his faculties, was perpetually talking of writing to your lordship,
  though without seeming to have anything which, at least, he was at all
  capable of communicating to you." Bishop Benson writes to the Bishop of
  Oxford (June 12) that Butler's "attention to any one or anything is
  immediately lost and gone;" and, "my lord is incapable, not only of
  reading, but attending to anything read or said." And again, "his
  attention to anything is very little or none."</p>

  <p>There was certainly an interval between this time (June 12) and "the
  last four-and-twenty hours" preceding his death, during which, writes
  Bishop Benson (June 17), Butler "said kind and affecting things more than
  I could bear." Yet, on the whole, I submit that these extracts, if fully
  weighed and considered with all the attending circumstances, contain
  enough of even positive evidence to refute conclusively the injurious
  suspicions alluded to by X.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Z., if such are still current.</p>

<h3>MITIGATION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT TO FORGERS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iv., p. 434., &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>I have asked many questions, and turned over many volumes and files of
  newspapers, to get at the real facts of the cases of mitigation stated in
  "N. &amp; Q." Having winnowed the chaff as thoroughly as I could, I send
  the very few grains I have found. Those only who have searched annual
  registers, magazines, and journals for the foundation of stories
  defective in names and dates, will appreciate my difficulties.</p>

  <p>I have not found any printed account of the "Jeannie Deans" case, "N.
  &amp; Q.," Vol. iv., p. 434.; Vol. v., p. 444.; Vol. vi., p. 153. I have
  inquired of the older members of the Northern Circuit, and they never
  heard of it. Still a young man may have been convicted of forgery "about
  thirty-five years ago:" his sister may have presented a well-signed
  petition to the judges, and the sentence may have been commuted without
  the tradition surviving on the circuit. All however agree, that no man
  who ever sat on the bench deserved the imputation of "obduracy" less than
  Baron Graham. I should not have noticed the anecdote but for its
  <i>mythic</i> accompaniments, which I disposed of in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol.
  v., p. 444.</p>

  <p>In Vol. vi., p. 496., W.&nbsp;W. cites from Wade's <i>British
  History</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"July 22, 1814. Admiral William B&mdash;&mdash;y found guilty of
  forging letters to defraud the revenue. He was sentenced to death, which
  was commuted to banishment."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The case is reported in <i>The Sun</i>, July 25, 1814; and the
  subsequent facts are in <i>The Times</i>, July 30, and August 16 and 20.
  It was tried before Mr. Justice Dampier at the Winchester Summer Assizes.
  There were five bills against the prisoner for forgery, and one for a
  fraud. That on which he was convicted, was for defrauding the post-master
  of Gosport of 3<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> He took to the post-office
  a packet of 114 letters, which he said were "ship letters," from the
  "Mary and Jane." He received the postage, and signed the receipt "W.
  Johnstone." The letters were fictitious. The case was fully proved, and
  he received sentence of death. He was respited for a fortnight, and
  afterwards during the pleasure of the Prince Regent. He was struck off
  the list of retired <!-- Page 574 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page574"></a>{574}</span> rear-admirals. It was proved at the
  trial, that, in 1809, he commanded "The Plantagenet;" but, <i>from the
  unsettled state of his mind</i>, the command had been given up to the
  first lieutenant, and that he was shortly after superseded. This, and the
  good character he received, were probably held to excuse the pardon.</p>

  <p>I now come to the great case of George III. and Mr. Fawcett. I much
  regret that <span class="sc">Whunside</span> has not replied in your
  pages to my question (Vol. vii., p. 163.), as I could then have commented
  upon the facts, and his means of knowing them, with more freedom. I have
  a private communication from him, which is ample and candid. He objects
  to bring his name before the public, and I have no right to press that
  point. He is not <i>quite</i> certain as to the convict's name, but can
  procure it for me. He would rather that it should not be published, as it
  might give pain to a respectable family. Appreciating the objection, and
  having no use for it except to publish, I have declined to ask it of
  him.</p>

  <p>The case occurred in 1802 or 1803, when <span
  class="sc">Whunside</span> was a pupil of Mr. Fawcett. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Occasionally Mr. Fawcett used to allow certain portions of a weekly
  newspaper to be read to the boys on a Saturday evening. This case was
  read to us, I think from the <i>Leeds Mercury</i>; and though Mr.
  Fawcett's name was not mentioned, we were all aware who the minister
  was."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus we have no <i>direct</i> evidence of the amount of Mr. Fawcett's
  communications with George III. How much of the story as it is now told
  was read to the boys, we do not know; but that it came to them first
  through a weekly paper, is rather against than for it.</p>

  <p>We all know the tendency of good stories to pick up additions as they
  go. I have read that the first edition of the <i>Life of Loyola</i> was
  without miracles. This anecdote seems to have reached its full growth in
  1823, in Pearson's <i>Life of W. Hey, Esq.</i>, and probably in the two
  lives of George III., published after his death, and mentioned by <span
  class="sc">Whunside</span>. Pearson, as cited in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vi.,
  p. 276., says, that by some means the <i>Essay on Anger</i> had been
  recommended to the notice of George III., who would have made the author
  a bishop had he not been a dissenter; that he signified his wish to serve
  Mr. Fawcett, &amp;c. That on the conviction of H&mdash;&mdash;, Mr.
  Fawcett wrote to the king; and a letter soon arrived, conveying the
  welcome intelligence, "You may rest assured that his life is safe,"
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>It is not stated that this was "private and confidential:" if it was,
  Mr. Fawcett had no right to mention it; if it was not, he had no reason
  for concealing what was so much to his honour, and so extraordinary as
  the king's personal interference in a matter invariably left to the
  Secretary of State for the Home Department. If, however, Mr. Fawcett was
  silent from modesty, his biographers had no inducement to be so; yet, let
  us see how they state the case. The <i>Account of the Life, Writings, and
  Ministry of the late Rev. John Fawcett</i>: London, 1818, cited in "N.
  &amp; Q.," Vol. vi., p. 229., says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"He was induced, <i>in conjunction with others</i>, to solicit the
  exercise of royal clemency in mitigating the severity of that punishment
  which the law denounces: and it gladdened the sympathetic feelings of his
  heart to know that these petitions were not unavailing; but the modesty
  of his character made him regret the publicity which had been given to
  this subject."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The fifth edition of the <i>Essay on Anger, printed for the Book
  Society for Promoting Religious Knowledge</i>, London, no date, has a
  memoir of the author. The "incident" is said not to have been circulated
  <i>in any publication by the family</i>; but "it was one of the secrets
  which obtain a wider circulation from the reserve with which one relator
  invariably retails it to another." That is exactly my view. Secrecy
  contributes to diffusion, but not to accuracy. At the risk of being
  thought tedious, I must copy the rest of this statement:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Soon after the publication of this treatise, <i>the author took an
  opportunity of presenting a copy</i> to our late much revered sovereign;
  whose ear was always accessible to merit, however obscure the individual
  in whom it was found. Contrary to the fate of most publications laid at
  the feet of royalty, it was diligently perused and admired; and a
  communication of this approbation was afterwards made known to the
  author. It happened some time afterwards, a relative of one of his
  friends was convicted of a capital crime, for which he was left for
  execution. Application was instantly made for an extension of royal
  favour in his behalf; and, among others, one was made by Mr. Fawcett: and
  his majesty, <i>no doubt recollecting the pleasure he had derived from
  the perusal of his</i> Essay on Anger, <i>and believing that he would not
  recommend an improper person to royal favour</i>, was most graciously
  pleased to answer the prayer of the petition; but <i>as to precisely how
  far the name of Mr. Fawcett might have contributed to this successful
  application must await the great disclosures of a future
  judgment.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The reader will sift this jumble of inferences and facts, and perhaps
  will not go so far as to have "no doubt."</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Whunside</span> tells me, that about 1807 he employed
  a bookbinder from Halifax; who, on hearing that he had been a pupil of
  Mr. Fawcett, said he had seen two copies of the <i>Essay on Anger</i>,
  most beautifully bound, to be sent to the king.</p>

  <p>The conclusion to which I come is, that Mr. Fawcett sent a copy of the
  <i>Essay on Anger</i> to the king; that the receipt of it was
  acknowledged, possibly in some way more complimentary than the ordinary
  circular; that a young man was convicted of forgery; that Mr. Fawcett and
  others petitioned for his pardon, and that he was <!-- Page 575 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page575"></a>{575}</span> pardoned. All the rest
  I hold to be mere rumours, not countenanced by Mr. Fawcett or his family,
  and not <i>asserted</i> by his biographers.</p>

<h3>MYTHE VERSUS MYTH.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 326.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Keightley's</span> rule is only partially true,
  and in the part which is true is not fully stated. The following rules,
  qualified by the accompanying remarks, will I trust be found
  substantially correct.</p>

  <p>English monosyllables, formed from Greek or Latin monosyllabic
  roots,</p>

  <p>(1.) When the root ends in a single consonant preceded by a vowel,
  require the lengthening <i>e</i>.</p>

  <p>(2.) When the root ends in a single consonant preceded by a diphthong,
  or in more than one consonant preceded by a vowel, reject the
  <i>e</i>.</p>

  <p>1. Examples from the Greek:&mdash;<span title="schêm-a" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&chi;&#x1FC6;&mu;-&alpha;</span>, <i>scheme</i>; <span
  title="lur-a" class="grk">&lambda;&#x1F7B;&rho;-&alpha;</span> (lyr-a),
  <i>lyre</i>; <span title="zôn-ê" class="grk"
  >&zeta;&#x1F7D;&nu;-&eta;</span> (zon-a), <i>zon-e</i>; <span
  title="bas-is" class="grk">&beta;&#x1F71;&sigma;-&iota;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>base</i>; <span title="phras-is" class="grk"
  >&phi;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;-&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>phras-e</i>; <span
  title="trop-os" class="grk"
  >&tau;&rho;&#x1F79;&pi;-&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>trop-e</i>. From
  Latin, ros-a, <i>ros-e</i>; fin-is, <i>fin-e</i>; fum-us, <i>fum-e</i>;
  pur-us, <i>pur-e</i>; grad-us, <i>grad-e</i>. Compare, in verbs, ced-o,
  <i>ced-e</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This rule admits of a modification; <i>e.g.</i>
  we form from <span title="zêl-os" class="grk"
  >&zeta;&#x1FC6;&lambda;-&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> <i>zeal</i> (the sound
  hardly perceptibly differing from <i>zel-e</i>); from <span title="hôr-a" class="grk"
  >&#x1F65;&rho;-&alpha;</span> (hor-a), <i>hour</i>; from flos (flor-is),
  <i>flower</i> and <i>flour</i> (the long sound communicated to the vowel
  in the other words by the added <i>e</i>, being in these already
  contained in the diphthong). Add ven-a, <i>vein</i>; van-us, <i>vain</i>;
  sol-um, <i>soil</i>, &amp;c.; and compare <i>-ceed</i> in <i>proceed</i>,
  <i>succeed</i>, formed from compounds of ced-o. Some, but not all, of
  these words have come to us through the French.</p>

  <p>2. Examples from the Greek:&mdash;<span title="rheum-a" class="grk"
  >&#x1FE5;&epsilon;&#x1FE6;&mu;-&alpha;</span>, <i>rheum</i>; <span
  title="chasm-a" class="grk">&chi;&#x1F71;&sigma;&mu;-&alpha;</span>,
  <i>chasm</i>; <span title="murr-a" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1F7B;&rho;&rho;-&alpha;</span>, <i>myrrh</i>; <span
  title="glôss-a" class="grk"
  >&gamma;&lambda;&#x1FF6;&sigma;&sigma;-&alpha;</span>, <i>gloss</i>;
  <span title="numph-ê" class="grk">&nu;&#x1F7B;&mu;&phi;-&eta;</span>
  (nymph-a), <i>nymph</i>; <span title="disk-os" class="grk"
  >&delta;&#x1F77;&sigma;&kappa;-&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, (disc-us),
  <i>disk</i>; <span title="plinth-os" class="grk"
  >&pi;&lambda;&#x1F77;&nu;&theta;-&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>plinth</i>;
  <span title="psalm-os" class="grk"
  >&psi;&alpha;&lambda;&mu;-&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>psalm</i>. From
  Latin, fraus (fraud-is), <i>fraud</i>; laus (laud-is), <i>laud</i>;
  plant-a, <i>plant</i>; orb-is, <i>orb</i>; plumb-um, <i>plumb</i>;
  long-us, <i>long</i>, flux-us, <i>flux</i>; port-us, <i>port</i>.
  Compare, in verbs, damn-o, <i>damn</i>; err-o, <i>err</i>; add-o,
  <i>add</i>; vex-o, <i>vex</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;From roots ending in the same consonant doubled,
  our derived words ordinarily drop one of them; <i>e.g.</i> <span
  title="stemm-a" class="grk">&sigma;&tau;&#x1F73;&mu;&mu;-&alpha;</span>,
  <i>stem</i>; gemm-a, <i>gem</i>; summ-a, <i>sum</i>; penn-a, <i>pen</i>;
  carr-us, <i>car</i>. (Note this tendency of our language, by comparing
  our <i>man</i> with the German <i>mann</i>.)</p>

  <p>If the root ends in <i>s</i> or <i>v</i> preceded by a diphthong, or
  in a consonant +<i>s</i><a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> or +<i>v</i> preceded by a vowel,
  our derived words add <i>e</i>, <i>as</i> <span title="paus-is" class="grk"
  >&pi;&alpha;&#x1FE6;&sigma;-&iota;&sigmaf;</span> (paus-a),
  <i>paus-e</i>; caus-a, <i>cause-e</i>; næv-a, <i>nav-e</i>; puls-us,
  <i>puls-e</i>; dens-us, <i>dens-e</i>; <span title="haps-is" class="grk"
  >&#x1F01;&psi;-&#x1F77;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>aps-e</i>; laps-us,
  <i>laps-e</i>; vers-us, <i>vers-e</i>; valv-a, <i>valv-e</i>; nerv-us,
  <i>nerv-e</i>.<a name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
  The cause of this lies in the genius of our language, which totally
  rejects the ending <i>v</i>, and uses <i>s</i> (single) very sparingly in
  the singular number, except in the ending <i>ous</i>, the genitive case,
  the third person of the present tense, the obsolete <i>wis</i>, and
  <i>was</i>. Other words are, the interjection <i>alas</i>; pronouns or
  pronominal particles; proper names, as <i>Thomas</i>, <i>Chaos</i>;
  compounds, as <i>Lammas</i>, <i>Christmas</i>; <i>plural</i> adverbs, as
  <i>towards</i>, <i>thereabouts</i>; and the (perhaps)
  <i>plural</i>&mdash;it ought to be so&mdash;<i>alms</i>.<a
  name="footnotetag7" href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>From roots ending in a mute +<i>a</i> liquid, our derived words also
  end in <i>e</i>, and are then in fact dissyllables; <i>e.g.</i> <span
  title="bibl-os" class="grk"
  >&beta;&#x1F77;&beta;&lambda;-&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>bible</i>;
  <span title="kukl-os" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F7B;&kappa;&lambda;-&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>cycl-e</i>;
  <span title="mitr-a" class="grk">&mu;&#x1F77;&tau;&rho;-&alpha;</span>,
  <i>mitr-e</i>; <span title="nitr-on" class="grk"
  >&nu;&#x1F77;&tau;&rho;-&omicron;&nu;</span>, <i>nitr-e</i>; <span
  title="petr-os" class="grk"
  >&pi;&#x1F73;&tau;&rho;-&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>petr-e</i>. In this
  class of words the final letters (after the analogy of Latin) have
  sometimes become transposed; <i>e.g.</i> <span title="lepr-os" class="grk"
  >&lambda;&epsilon;&pi;&rho;-&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>lep-er</i>. So
  now-a-days, <i>cent-er</i> as well as <i>centr-e</i>. Compare
  <i>metr-e</i>, <i>diamet-er</i>.</p>

  <p>To apply our rules to the words required to be formed in an English
  shape from <span title="muth-os" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1FE6;&theta;-&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>.</p>

  <p>Very few words in our language end in <i>th</i> which are not of
  purely native growth. <i>Frith</i> is questionable exception. Besides the
  monosyllable <i>plinth</i>, we have imported from the Greek
  <i>colocynth</i>, <i>hyacinth</i>, <i>labyrinth</i>, with the proper
  names <i>Corinth</i>, <i>Erymanth</i>, all terminating in <i>nth</i>.</p>

  <p>In the ending <i>the</i> our language does not rejoice. Most of such
  words are verbs, so distinguished from their cognate substantives, as
  <i>wreathe</i> from <i>wreath</i>. We have, as substantives, <i>lathe</i>
  (A.-S. <span lang="ang" class="saxon" title="leð" >leð</span>),
  <i>hythe</i> (<span lang="ang" class="saxon" title="hyð" >hyð</span>),
  <i>scythe</i> (more properly <i>sithe</i>, <span lang="ang" class="saxon"
  title="siðe" >s&#x131;ðe</span>), <i>tythe</i> (<span lang="ang"
  class="saxon" title="tyðe" >tyðe</span>); as adjectives, <i>blithe</i>
  (<span lang="ang" class="saxon" title="bliðe" >bl&#x131;ðe</span>),
  <i>lithe</i> (<span lang="ang" class="saxon" title="lið"
  >l&#x131;ð</span>). There may be one or two more.</p>

  <p>In all these the sounds is <span lang="ang" class="saxon" title="ð"
  >ð</span> (<i>th</i> in <i>this</i>) not <span lang="ang" class="saxon"
  title="þ" >þ</span> (<i>th</i> in <i>thick</i>). This appears worth
  notice.</p>

  <p>On the whole, I should venture to say that so uncouth a slip as
  <i>mythe</i>, when set in our soil, was unlikely to thrive. Still <span
  class="special" title="The 'y-breve' of the original is not available"
  ><i>myth</i></span> is objectionable, though we at Cambridge might quote
  <span class="special" title="The 'y-breve' of the original is not available"
  ><i>gyp</i></span>. However I may seem to be a breaker of my own laws, I
  suggest, if we must have an English form of the word, that we should
  write and pronounce <i>m<span class="over">y</span>th</i>. Several words
  ending in <i>th</i> have the preceding vowel lengthened, <i>e.g.</i>
  <i>both</i>, <i>sloth</i>, <i>ruth</i>, <i>truth</i> (though with the
  inconsistency attributed to us, one, by the way, generally of orthography
  rather than pronunciation, we shorten the diphthong in <i>breath</i>,
  <i>death</i>). Compare also the sound of the endings <i>ild</i> and
  <i>ind</i>.</p>

  <p>I have already troubled you with a very long Note; but, before I
  close, allow me to add that in what I have advanced I have had in view
  only our modern mode of spelling, without binding <!-- Page 576 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page576"></a>{576}</span> myself to an opinion
  of its inferiority or superiority to that of our forefathers. I beg also
  to protest against <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley's</span> wish to banish
  <i>mythical</i> from our vocabulary. It may be <i>hybrid</i>, but equally
  so are <i>critical</i>, <i>grammatical</i>, <i>musical</i>,
  <i>physical</i>, <i>poetical</i>, with a long string of et ceteras.</p>

<h3>"INQUIRY INTO THE STATE OF THE UNION, BY
THE WEDNESDAY CLUB IN FRIDAY STREET."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 261. 409.)</p>

  <p>This very able and valuable work, as to which your correspondent
  inquires, was written by Wm. Paterson, the projector of the Bank of
  England and the Darien scheme; a great and memorable name, but which, to
  the discredit of British biography, will be sought for in vain in
  Chalmers's or our other biographical dictionaries. The book above noticed
  appears to be a continuation of another tract by the same author,
  entitled <i>An Inquiry into the Reasonableness and Consequences of an
  Union with Scotland, containing a brief Deduction of what hath been done,
  designed, or proposed in the Matter of the Union during the last Age, a
  Scheme of an Union as accommodated to the present Circumstances of the
  two Nations, also States of the respective Revenues, Debts, Weights,
  Measures, Taxes, and Impositions, and of other Facts of moment: with
  Observations thereupon, as communicated to Laurence Philips, Esq., near
  York</i>: London, printed and sold by R. Bragg, 1706, 8vo., 160 pages.
  This was preceded by an earlier tract by the same author: <i>Conferences
  on the Public Debts, by the Wednesday's Club in Friday Street</i>:
  London, 1695, 4to. The last is noticed, with a short account of the
  author, by Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Culloch (<i>Lib. of Political Economy</i>, p.
  159.), but he has not mentioned the two other works previously adverted
  to. In all of them the author adopts the form of a report of the
  proceedings of a club; but, without attempting to deny the actual
  existence of a Wednesday's club in Friday Street (the designation he
  assumes for it), nothing can be more clear to any one who reads the three
  tracts than that the conversations, proceedings, and personages mentioned
  are all the creatures of his own fertile invention, and made use of, more
  conveniently to bring out his facts, arguments, and statements. The
  dramatic form he gives them makes even the dry details of finance
  amusing; and abounding, as they do, in information and thought, these
  works may always be consulted with profit and pleasure. The <i>Inquiry
  into the State of the Union</i>, 1717, 8vo., for which Walpole is said to
  have furnished some of the materials, was answered, but rather feebly, in
  an anonymous pamphlet entitled <i>Wednesday Club Law; or the Injustice,
  Dishonour, and Ill Policy of breaking into Parliamentary Contracts for
  public Debts</i>: London, printed for E. Smith, 1717, 8vo., pp. 38. The
  author of this pamphlet appears to have been a Mr. Broome. Those who
  would wish see one of the financial questions discussed in the
  <i>Inquiry</i> treated with equal force and ability, and with similar
  views, by a great cotemporary of Paterson, whose pamphlet came out
  simultaneously, may read <i>Fair Payment no Spunge; or some
  Considerations on the Unreasonableness of refusing to receive back Money
  lent on public Securities, and the Necessity of setting the Nation free
  from the unsupportable Burthen of Debt and Taxes, with a View of the
  great Advantage and Benefit which will arise to Trade and to the Landed
  Interest, as well as to the Poor, by having these heavy Grievances taken
  off</i>: London, printed and sold by Brotherton: Meadows and Roberts,
  1717, 8vo., pp. 79. This is one of the pamphlets which, though it has
  been sometimes erroneously assigned to Paterson, both on external and
  internal evidence may be confidently attributed to Defoe, but which has
  unaccountably escaped the notice of all his biographers.</p>

<h3>UNPUBLISHED EPIGRAM BY SIR W. SCOTT (?).</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 498.)</p>

  <p>The lines which your correspondent <span class="sc">R. Vincent</span>
  attributes to Sir Walter Scott are part of an old English inscription
  which Longfellow quotes in <i>Outremer</i>, p. 66., and thus describes in
  a note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"I subjoin this relic of old English verse entire.... It is copied
  from a book whose title I have forgotten, and of which I have but a
  single leaf, containing the poem. In describing the antiquities of the
  church of Stratford-upon-Avon, the writer gives the following account of
  a very old painting upon the wall, and of the poem which served as its
  motto. The painting is no longer visible, having been effaced in
  repairing the church:</p>

  <p>"'Against the west wall of the nave, on the south side of the arch,
  was painted the martyrdom of Thomas à Becket, while kneeling at the altar
  of St. Benedict, in Canterbury Cathedral. Below this was the figure of an
  angel, probably St. Michael, supporting a long scroll, upon which were
  seven stanzas in old English, being an allegory of mortality.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The lines given at p. 498. of "N. &amp; Q." seem to be taken from the
  two following stanzas, which stand third and fourth in the old
  inscription:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Erth apon erth wynnys castellys and towrys,</i></p>
      <p><i>Then seth erth unto erth thys ys all owrys.</i></p>
      <p>When erth apon erth hath bylde hys bowrys,</p>

      <p><i>And yet schall erth unto erth rather than he wold.</i>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 577 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page577"></a>{577}</span></p>

  <p>Dugdale, in his <i>Antiquities of Warwickshire</i>, p. 517., tells us
  that John de Stratford, who was Archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of
  Edward III., built a chapel on the south side of the church, "to the
  honour of God and of St. Thomas the Martyr;" and as at p. 521. he
  describes it as "in the south ile of the said church," the west wall of
  this chapel answers very well the description of the position of the
  painting, and inscription. But in <i>The Beauties of England and
  Wales</i>, vol. xv. p. 238., <i>the chapel of the gild of the Holy
  Cross</i>, in the centre of the town, is mentioned as the place in which
  the pictures were discovered, during some repairs which it underwent in
  the year 1804.</p>

  <p>I have since ascertained that the work to which Longfellow refers is
  Weaver's <i>Account of Stratford-upon-Avon</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Erica</span>.

  <p>As a companion to the <i>unpublished</i> epigram in No. 186. of "N.

  about thirty years since, and referring, as I <i>believe</i>, to an old
  brass in the church of St. Helen's, London:</p>

<h3>CHURCH CATECHISM.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 190. 463.)</p>

  <p>In accordance with the request of Z.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;R., I have pleasure in
  forwarding the extracts from the <i>Catechismus brevis et Catholicus</i>,
  referred to at pp. 190. 463. of the present volume. It is needful to
  premise, 1. That the pages of the catechism are not numbered. This will
  account for the absence of precise references. 2. That only so much is
  quoted as may exhibit the parallelism; and, 3. That the citations are not
  consecutive in the original, but arranged in the order of the questions
  and answers of the <i>Church Catechism</i>, beginning with the fourteenth
  question, "How many sacraments hath Christ ordained in His Church?"</p>

  <p><i>Q.</i> 14. How many, &amp;c.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Quot sunt Ecclesiæ Catholicæ Sacramenta?</p>

  <p>[<i>Similarly of the Eucharist.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Q.</i> 16. How many parts, &amp;c.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Habetque unumquodque horum (quod sacramentis peculiare est verbum)
  Elementum, et Gratiam invisibilem. Quod verbum nos docet, et promittit

  hoc idem Gratia quoque (nisi tamen obicem objiciat homo) in anima
  invisibiliter operatur.</p>

<h3>JACOB BOBART, ETC.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 428.)</p>

  <p>Of old Jacob Bobart, who originally came from Brunswick, Granger
  (<i>Biog. Hist.</i>, vol. v. p. 287., edit. 1824) gives us the following
  account:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Jacob Bobart, a German, whom Plot styles 'an excellent gardener and
  botanist,' was, by the Earl of Danby, founder of the physic-garden at
  Oxford, appointed the first keeper of it. He was author of <i>Catalogus
  Plantarum Horti Medici Oxoniensis, scil. Latino-Anglicus et
  Anglico-Latinus</i>: Oxon. 1648, 8vo. One singularity I have heard of him
  from a gentleman of unquestionable veracity, that on rejoicing days he
  used to have his beard tagged with silver. The same gentleman informed
  me, that there is a portrait of him in the possession of one of the
  corporation at Woodstock. He died the 4th of February, 1679, in the
  eighty-first year of his age. He had two sons, Tillemant and Jacob, who
  both belonged to the physic-garden. It appears that the latter succeeded
  him in his office."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is a very fine print of the elder Bobart, now extremely scarce,
  "D. Loggan del., M. Burghers, sculp." It is a quarto of the largest size.
  Beneath the head, which is dated 1675, is this distich:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thou German prince of plants, each year to thee</p>
      <p>Thousands of subjects grant a subsidy."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In John Evelyn's <i>Diary</i>, under the date Oct. 24, 1664, is the
  following entry:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Next to Wadham, and the physic garden, where were two large
  locust-trees, and as many platani (plane-trees), and some rare plants
  under the culture of old Bobart."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The editor of the last edition, after repeating part of Granger's
  note, and mentioning the portrait, adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"There is a small whole-length in the frontispiece of
  <i>Vertumnus</i>, a poem on that garden. In this he is dressed in a long
  vest, with a beard. One of his family was bred up at college in Oxford;
  but quitted his studies for the profession of the whip, driving one of
  the Oxford coaches (his own property) for many years with great credit.
  In 1813 he broke his leg by an accident; and in 1814, from the respect he
  had acquired by his good conduct, he was appointed by the University to
  the place of one of the Esquire Beadles."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Vertumnus</i>, the poem mentioned in the above note, was addressed
  to Mr. Jacob Bobart, in 1713, by Dr. Evans. It is a laudatory epistle on
  the botanical knowledge of the Bobarts; and we learn from it that Jacob,
  the younger, collected a <i>Hortus Siccus</i> (a collection of plants
  pasted upon paper, and kept dry in a book) in twenty volumes.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thy <i>Hortus Siccus</i> ...</p>
      <p>In tomes twice ten, that world immense!</p>
      <p>By thee compiled at vast expense."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The broadsides about which <span class="sc">H.&nbsp;T. Bobart</span>
  inquires are of the greatest possible rarity. They were the production of
  Edmund Gayton, the author of <i>Festivious Notes on Don Quixote</i>,
  &amp;c. Copies may be seen in the Ashmolean Library, under the
  press-marks Nos. 423. and 438., but I think not in any other repository
  of a like nature.</p>

  <p>Among the Ashmolean MSS. (No. 36, art. 296.) is a poem of 110 lines
  "Upon the most hopeful and ever-flourishing Sprouts of Valour, the
  indefatigable Centrys of the Physick-Garden." This, I apprehend, is a MS.
  copy of the first broadside mentioned by your correspondent.</p>

  <p>I shall merely add, the Bobarts, father and son, were personal friends
  of Ashmole and Ray, and that, in all probability, among their
  correspondence much curious and minute information might be obtained.</p>

<h3>"ITS."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 510.)</p>

  <p>I was somewhat surprised to find, in No. 186. of "N. &amp; Q.," two
  instances quoted of the use of the <!-- Page 579 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page579"></a>{579}</span> word "its" in the
  version of the Bible. It has long been an established opinion that this
  word did not exist in it; and the fact has been recently referred to by
  two different authorities, <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span> in "N.
  &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 160., and Mr. Watts of the British Museum, in a
  paper "On some philological peculiarities in the English authorised
  Version of the Bible," read before the Philological Society on December
  10, 1852.</p>

  <p>Feeling curious on the subject, I have taken the trouble of referring
  to several different versions of the Bible in the British Museum, and the
  following <i>variorum</i> readings of the verses quoted by your
  correspondent B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C. are the result:</p>

  <p>1. The Wickliffite version, before 1390 (edit. Forshall and
  Wadden):</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"And he shal ben as a tree, that is plauntid beside the doun rennyngis
  of watris; that <i>his</i> frut shal <span class="special" title="3ive - letter yogh"
  >&#x21D;ive</span> in <i>his</i> time."&mdash;Ps. i. 3.</p>

  <p>"Duke of the weie thou were in <i>his</i> (<i>sc.</i> the vine) <span
  class="special" title="si3t - letter yogh">si&#x21D;t</span>; and thou
  plauntidist <i>his</i> rootis, and it fulfilde the erthe."&mdash;Ps.
  lxxx. 10.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>2. Coverdale's Bible, 1536:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Y<sup>t</sup> br&#x12B;geth forth <i>his</i> frute in due
  season."</p>

  <p>"Thou maydest rowme for it, and caused it to take rote, so
  y<sup>t</sup> it fylled the l&#x14D;de."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>3. Matthews, 1537:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"That bryngeth forth <i>his</i> frute in due season."</p>

  <p>"Thou madest rowme for it, and caused it to take rote, so that it
  fylled the lande."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>4. Cranmer, 1539:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Y<sup>t</sup> wyll brynge forth <i>hys</i> frute in due season."</p>

  <p>"Thou madest rowme for it, and whan it had taken rote it fylled
  y<sup>e</sup> lande."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>5. The Bishops' Bible, 1568:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"That bryngeth foorth <i>her</i> fruite in due season."</p>

  <p>"Thou madst roome before it, thou causedst it to take roote, and it
  hath filled the lande."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>6. Geneva Bible, 1578. In this there are two translations, one
  "according to the Ebrewe," the other "used in the Common Prayer":</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>i. "That wil bring forth <i>her</i> fruite in due season."</p>

  <p>ii. "That will bring forth <i>his</i> fruite in due season."</p>

  <p>i. "Thou madest roome for it, and when it had taken roote, it filled
  the lande."</p>

  <p>ii. "Thou madest roume for it, and didest cause it to take roote, and
  it filled the land."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>7. The Douay Bible (Roman Catholic version), 1609-10:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Which shal geue <i>his</i> fruite in <i>his</i> time."</p>

  <p>"Thou wast the guide of the way in the sight <i>thereof</i>; thou
  didst plant the rootes <i>thereof</i>, and it filled the earth."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>8. Authorised version, 1611:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"That bringeth forth <i>his</i> fruit in <i>his</i> season."</p>

  <p>"Thou preparedst roome before it, and didst cause it to take deepe
  roote, and it filled the land."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It will thus be perceived that "its" is wanting in all the above
  passages, and that "his," "her," and "thereof" invariably supply its
  place. I have been equally unsuccessful in detecting the word in the
  Common Prayer-Book version of the Psalms, which is well known to be that
  of the "Great Bible," or Cranmer's edition of 1539, and which has
  remained in use without alteration ever since. May I therefore ask
  B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C. to be so good as to point out the particular "Old version of the
  Psalms" from which he has derived his quotation?</p>

<h3>BOHN'S EDITION OF HOVEDEN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 495.)</p>

  <p>In reply to your correspondent's remarks (May 21) on my translation of
  Hoveden, I beg to state that, in suggesting Cork, I did not allude to the
  city of Cork, but the <i>territory</i> of Desmond or Cork, which probably
  extended to within a short distance of Waterford. Hoveden more than once,
  in his foreign geography, confounds places with territories or kingdoms;
  this fact, and the similarity of the names, <i>Croch</i> and
  <i>Corch</i>, as the kingdom of Cork is elsewhere called by him, led me
  to believe that a landing in the territory of Cork was meant. "Crook,"
  "Hook Point," or "The Crook," is only <i>supposed</i> to have been the
  place of landing on this occasion. I confess that I was not aware that
  "Erupolis" was an alias of the diocese of Ossory: I cannot find it
  mentioned as such in the dictionaries at my command. My Note, however,
  was worded in such a way as to give offence to no reasonable person: and,
  among the many hundreds, perhaps thousands of suggestions, made in the
  notes (in a proper spirit, I hope,) I should be greatly surprised to find
  that I had miscarried in none. For your correspondent's information, I
  beg to state, that I am not an Irishman either by birth or descent; and
  that I have never had the good fortune to pay a visit to that country.
  Were I inclined to follow his example in making remarks upon the
  "ominousness" of names, I might perhaps retaliate upon him with
  interest.</p>

  <p>Why I have forfeited all claim to be treated by this gentleman with
  courtesy or common politeness, I am quite at a loss to conceive; but I
  beg to remind him that vituperation does not carry conviction, and that
  criticism is enfeebled by an alliance with abuse.</p>

<h3>BOOKS OF EMBLEMS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 469.)</p>

  <p>In your 185th Number, two or three Queries are proposed by the <span
  class="sc">Rev. Mr. Corser</span> in <!-- Page 580 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page580"></a>{580}</span> connexion with that
  interesting branch of literature called <i>Books of Emblems</i>. To these
  it shall be my endeavour to reply.</p>

  <p>First. Some years ago I made particular inquiry from the surviving
  relatives of the late Rev. William Beloe, whether among his manuscripts
  there had been found any "Treatise on Emblems," or any notices which had
  a bearing on the subject? They informed me that they had made search, but
  without success.</p>

  <p>Second. Of Thomas Combe, mentioned by Meres in his <i>Palladis
  Tamia</i>, I have been unable to learn anything.</p>

  <p>Third. It appears certain that Bunyan never published any <i>Book of
  Emblems</i>, whatever may have been hawked under his name; nor can I
  find, in the Account of his Life and Writings just published in Glasgow,
  Edinburgh, and London, or in any preceding edition of his works, that
  such a production was ever contemplated by him.</p>

  <p>Fourth. In the extensive and valuable "English Books of Emblems"
  furnished (chiefly from his own library) by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Corser</span>, he mentions R. Burton's <i>Choice Emblems, Divine and
  Moral; or Delights for the Ingenious, &amp;c.</i>, 12mo. 1721. Perhaps my
  learned and accomplished friend may not be aware that <i>Burton</i> is an
  <i>assumed</i> name, placed in the title-pages of several cheap books
  which appeared at the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the
  eighteenth centuries, but which were thought to have been written by a
  Mr. Nathaniel Crouch, a bookseller, who sold them. I have a sixth edition
  of these "choice emblems," dated 1732, which was then sold for "two
  shillings bound." The work is merely a collection of fifty emblems,
  taken, without acknowledgment, from George Wither, the copper-plate
  engravings being poor copies from those of Depasse. To this sixth edition
  there is prefixed a portrait of K. Charles I., with eight pages of
  sympathising verses.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Corser's</span> list of English works is very
  complete. I possess, however, an unpublished manuscript translation of
  Alciato into English verse. It is of the time of James I., and possesses
  much merit; but it has unfortunately been mutilated.</p>

  <p>I also possess the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Amorum Emblemata figuris æneis incisa studio Othonis Væni,
  Batavo-Lugdunensis. Emblemes of Love, with verses in Latin, English, and
  Italian, obl. 4to.: Antverpiæ, 1608."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Prefixed is an English dedication "to the most Honourable and Worthy
  Brothers William, Earl of Pembroke, and Philip, Earl of Montgomerie,
  Patrons of Learning and Chevalrie," whose coat of arms also is given.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The Doctrine of Morality, or a View of Human Life according to the
  Stoic Philosophy, &amp;c. A translation, by T.&nbsp;M. Gibbs, from the French
  of M. De Gomberville, with 103 copper plates by Daret, folio: London,
  1721."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To each engraving are appended quotations from Horace, &amp;c., with
  English translations: but both engravings and quotations have been
  pirated (without the least acknowledgment) from Van Veen's <i>Horatia
  Emblemata</i>.</p>

  <p>It must be admitted that a comprehensive work on European Books of
  Emblems, illustrated with fac-similes of the various engravings, &amp;c.,
  is a great desideratum in modern literature. I feel highly flattered by
  the kind commendations which <span class="sc">Mr. Corser</span> has
  bestowed upon my two small attempts towards such a work, and by his
  encouraging me to proceed "to enlarge and complete" the same. Now, I do
  not altogether despair of <i>enlarging</i> it. But when my excellent
  friend puts forward a proposal to <i>complete</i> it, he should be
  informed that my library alone contains nearly 250 volumes strictly
  emblematical, and published during the sixteenth and seventeenth
  centuries. By far the greater part of these are in Latin. To carry
  forward a work of such magnitude to anything like <i>completion</i> must
  therefore be rather wished for than expected.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Jos. B. Yates</span>.

  <p class="address">West Dingle, near Liverpool.

  <p>Allow me to add the following to <span class="sc">Mr. Corser's</span>
  list:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The Christian's Divine Amusement, consisting of Emblems and
  Hieroglyphicks on a great Variety of Subjects, Moral and Divine, in four
  books. By the late Rev. Mr. J. Jones. Embellished with near 100 beautiful
  emblematical cuts, 12mo. pp. 191.: London, 1764."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I know not who the Rev. Mr. J. was, but his book is the old one of
  Francis Quarles. The author, or rather adapter, attacks and demolishes
  the fable as a method of instruction, and would substitute the emblems.
  In remodelling Quarles, Mr. Jones makes the following alterations, or
  improvements:&mdash;Instead of the Latin motto under each cut, he
  presents us with four lines of English verse, which contain a general
  explanation of the emblem. The page facing the cut he divides into two
  parts or sections of odes and hymns suited to common psalmody, and the
  moral, or application, also in a poetical dress.</p>

  <p>A prose work belonging to the class under notice is an</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Emblematical Representation of the Paradise of God; showing the
  Nature of Spiritual Industry, in the similitude of a Garden well ordered,
  dressed, and kept. London, 1779."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The author of this was a visionary Scots gardener named Alexander
  Clark, who had been favoured with a special manifestation of divine
  glory, "by which," he says, "(to my own astonishment) I was enabled to
  see through every profound passage of Scripture, and to spiritualise
  every material thing;" but he belongs to my fanatical rather <!-- Page
  581 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page581"></a>{581}</span> than to
  my emblematical shelf, and may be worth a separate Note hereafter.</p>

  <p>Under the name of Farlie, or Fairlie, <span class="sc">Mr.
  Corser</span> mixes up the titles of two distinct books; they are now
  before me, and divide themselves thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>1. "Lychnocavsia, sive Moralia Facvm Emblemata. Light's Moral Emblems.
  Authore Roberto Farlæo, Scoto-Britanno. 12mo.: London, Th. Cotes for M.
  Sparke, 1638."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Containing fifty-eight emblems in Latin and English, each with a cut,
  with a dedication in Latin to the Earl of Ancrum, and one in English to
  his Countess. There are also complimentary verses by J. Hooper, Christ.
  Drayton, Mr. Povey, Thos. Beedome, and Edm. Coleman.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>2. "Kalendarium Humanæ Vitæ. The Kalendar of Man's Life. Authore
  R.&nbsp;F., S.-B. 12mo. London, for W. Hope, 1638."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With a Latin dedication to his patron the Earl of Ancrum. The book
  contains verses upon the various stages of man's life, under the heads of
  Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter; again subdivided into moralisations
  upon the months, as corresponding with the periods of life, as "August,
  or Man's Youth," &amp;c. This has also a variety of curious cuts, and
  both have engraved emblematical titles, the latter bearing on its face
  "G. Glover fecit."</p>

  <p>When book-rarities were in more request, these were costly little
  volumes; and I shall be glad if any of your correspondents can direct me
  where to find any notice of Robert Fairlie, the author of two of the most
  interesting of the emblematical series.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <span class="sc">Mr. Pollock</span> at the request of <span

  especial attention of our photographic friends, for the beauty and
  uniformity of its results.]</p>

</div>

<h3>MR. POLLOCK'S DIRECTIONS FOR OBTAINING POSITIVE
PHOTOGRAPHS UPON ALBUMENISED PAPER.</h3>

  <p><i>The paper</i> should be carefully chosen, by holding up every sheet
  to the light, and only those sheets which are homogeneous in appearance
  and free from spots should be kept for use.</p>

  <p><i>The albumen</i> should be obtained from new-laid hens' eggs;
  twenty-four is a convenient number to use at a time: these will yield
  twenty-four ounces of albumen, to which should be added six ounces of
  distilled writer (making thirty ounces in all) and four per cent. of
  chloride of ammonium, viz. one ounce and a quarter.</p>

  <p>The albumen water and chloride should be whipped with a silver fork
  for several minutes, and then put into a narrow tall jar, and allowed to
  stand for not less than two days (forty-eight hours). In cool weather it
  will keep well for eight days, at the end of which time the upper half of
  the albumen is to be poured off into a shallow vessel, rather larger than
  the sheets of paper intended to be albumenised.</p>

  <p><i>To put the Albumen on the Paper.</i>&mdash;Take a sheet by two
  opposite corners; turn one up; place the sheet boldly on the albumen, the
  centre first coming in contact with the albumen; lower the corners of the
  paper, gradually carefully excluding, the air. Let the sheet so placed
  remain four minutes: then take it by the turned up corner, and rip it
  from the albumen quickly, so as to carry up a quantity of the albumen
  with it. Let it drain for a minute or two, moving it so as not to allow
  the albumen to run in streaks; pin it to a piece of tape; and, when dry,
  pass a very hot iron over the back. This ends the albumenising
  process.</p>

  <p><i>To make the Paper sensitive.</i>&mdash;Place the albumenised side
  downwards, for four minutes, on the surface of a solution of nitrate of
  silver, of the strength of ninety grains to the ounce of distilled water;
  pin it up by one corner to dry, and keep it between pieces of
  blotting-paper. This must be done by yellow light, or the light of a
  candle.</p>

  <p><i>To print from the Negative.</i>&mdash;The simplest apparatus to
  have is a number of pieces of plate-glass a quarter of an inch thick,
  colourless, about twelve inches by ten in size.</p>

  <p>The sensitive paper is to be placed on one of the plates of glass,
  sensitive side upwards, and the negative is to be placed firmly upon it,
  collodion side downwards; and a second glass plate is then to be placed
  on the negative, and the whole arrangement exposed to the light. The time
  for exposure is from three minutes to an hour. With a little practice the
  negative can be lifted up, and the positive viewed front time to time,
  without any risk of displacement.</p>

  <p>The best rule is to print the lightest shade on the positive very
  decidedly darker than it would be wished that it should remain
  permanently.</p>

  <p><i>To fix the Positive.</i>&mdash;On removing it from the pressure
  frame, place it in a bath made as follows:</p>

    </td>
    <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>2 drops.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <p>Mix these: let them stand some hours; and filter before use. If the
  chloride of silver is omitted, the bath will do very well, but will very
  much improve with age, as it will acquire chloride of silver from the
  positives placed in it. <!-- Page 582 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page582"></a>{582}</span></p>

  <p>The time to leave the positive in the fixing bath varies from one hour
  to twelve. To get good black and white tints, the average time is five or
  six hours. When the desired tint is obtained, remove it into a bath
  composed of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Water      6 oz.</p>
      <p>Hypo.      1 oz.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Leave in this for half an hour, and then keep it in running water for
  several hours. If the water is hot, the time of soaking may be lessened:
  boiling water is objectionable. Nearly dry the positive between sheets of
  clean blotting-paper, and finish it by passing a very hot iron over
  it.</p>

  <p><i>General Remarks.</i>&mdash;The albumenised paper will keep any
  length of time in a dry place.</p>

  <p>When made sensitive, as directed, it will keep three days, always
  supposing that it is both prepared and kept most carefully excluded from
  white light. If, instead of a solution of nitrate of silver of ninety
  grains to the ounce, a weaker one be used, to make the paper sensitive,
  it will keep when sensitive a much longer time,&mdash;with a thirty-grain
  solution, a fortnight, or sometimes even a month; but then it does not
  give a positive of the same force and tone as that obtained with the
  stronger solution.</p>

  <p>After the fixing bath has done its day's work, it should be poured
  back into the bottle from which it came, and the bottle be filled up from
  the finishing bath; and so the bath is kept always of the same quantity;
  and by adding from time to time chloride of gold, it is kept of the same
  quality.</p>

  <p>The nitrate of silver and chloride of silver will never have to be
  renewed. The iodide of silver should be added as at first, viz. ten drops
  for about every two hundred positives fixed; and the acetic acid, viz.
  two drops for about every four hundred.</p>

  <p>In a bath of twenty-four ounces, as many as thirty positives, five
  inches by four, may be placed at one time: but the dark tints will then
  appear very slowly and gradually.</p>

  <p>To insure a good positive, next to having a good negative, it is most
  important to print of the right depth, neither too much nor too little.
  Great attention should be paid to this: for the finest tints are only to
  be obtained in positives exposed exactly the right time.</p>

  <p>Positives printed in a bright sun quickly are always better than those
  obtained by longer exposure without sun.</p>

  <p><i>Test for Lenses.</i>&mdash;In applying the methods recommended in
  your last Number for the purpose of testing lenses, there is one
  precaution absolutely necessary to be taken, but which all your
  correspondents have omitted to point out. The operator must take care
  that his <i>focussing-glass</i> is placed at precisely the same distance
  from the lens as the <i>collodionised</i> glass is. To insure this, my
  practice is to place a piece of ground glass in the dark frame, which is
  afterwards to receive the collodionised glass, and to obtain the focus of
  the lens on that; then to put in the proposed plate, and obtain an
  impression as described by <span class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span>. In this
  way I secure myself from what I believe is often a source of fallacy in
  these experiments, and am sure that I give the lens a fair trial.</p>

  <p><i>Washing Collodion Pictures.</i>&mdash;I have never offered to your
  readers an opinion in photography without having <i>bonâ fide</i> tested
  it, to the best of my ability; and however correct my friend <span
  class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span> may be, chemically and theoretically, I am
  convinced that in practice so good a tone is never obtained in a positive
  collodion picture which has been washed, as in one which has been
  instantly fixed with the old saturated solution of hyposulphite of soda.
  The unpleasant tints obtained upon positive collodion pictures, I believe
  to be much dependent upon the frequent washings in the proofs. When a
  collodion picture is properly treated, it surpasses in pleasing effect
  every other photograph.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Cremonas</i> (Vol. vii., p. 501.).&mdash;A discriminative account
  of the violins and basses by the great Italian makers, showing, in every
  ascertainable instance, the date of manufacture, and thereby forming to
  some extent a chronological catalogue, as it were, of the works of each
  master, would be, indeed, a curious and interesting achievement. Such a
  task, involving much consultation of books and examination of
  instruments, calls for sounder eye-sight and larger opportunities than
  are possessed by me; but I shall rejoice if the desire expressed by your
  correspondent H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. shall be found to have stirred up some competent
  investigator. Time and accident are gradually attaching, to the fine
  instruments in question, a kind of <i>sibylline</i> intensity of value;
  and the inquiry, if omitted now, may become impossible hereafter. Let us
  not fear, however, that those "cunning'st patterns of excelling art," the
  Amati, Stradivari, and Guarneri fiddles, will eventually perish without
  worthy issue, and "die, and leave the world no copy." Provision to the
  contrary, it seems, has already been made; Monsieur Vuillaume "has ta'en
  order for't," that is to say, <i>if</i> his instruments, which at present
  look very like faithful fac-similes of the renowned classic prototypes,
  shall verify the confident predictions of their admirers, by continuing
  to stand the test of time.</p>

  <p>My authority for 1664 as the date of birth of Antonio Stradivari, is a
  living Belgian writer, Monsieur Fétis, who has not stated from whence
  <!-- Page 583 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page583"></a>{583}</span>
  he has adopted it. I find that the Paris <i>Biographie Universelle</i>
  gives no fixed date, but only a conjectural one, <i>about</i> 1670, so
  that 1664 <i>may</i> possibly be right.</p>

  <p><i>James Chaloner</i> (Vol. vii., p. 334.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr.

  Isle of Man, and one of the judges of Charles I. He will find the error
  exposed by Chalmers (<i>Biog. Dict.</i>, <span class="sc">Jas</span>.

  The son of Sir Thomas Chaloner married Ursula Fairfax. It may be presumed
  the herald-painter did not stand in the same relationship to the

  <p>If your correspondent is curious about the particular MS. he mentions,
  which is a very old one, and was the gift of William Reade, Bishop of

  consult the <i>Catal. Lib. MSS. Ang. et Hib.</i>, part. ii. p. 23., Oxon.

  easily discover them in the <i>Bibliotheca Sancta</i> of Sixtus Senensis,
  lib. ii. pp. 102-104. Francof. 1575, or in Fabricii <i>Cod. Apoc. Nov.
  Test.</i>, ii. 892-904. Jacobus Faber Stapulensis has inserted them in
  the handsome volume of his <i>Commentaries on the Epistles of St.
  Paul</i>. (Fol. clxxvi.-clxxix.: Paris, 1517.) I find them also annexed
  to the <i>Epistole Francisci Philelphi</i>, 4to., Hagenau, 1514. So far
  as I can perceive, it does not appear that the correspondence in question
  was published amongst any of the works of Seneca earlier than the year
  1475; and it is commonly omitted in later editions. (Fabr., <i>Bib.

  <p><i>Meaning of "Worth"</i> (Vol. v., p. 509.).&mdash;As this suffix
  enters into the composition of many of our English surnames, particularly
  in the northern counties, <span class="sc">Mr. Lower</span> (and probably
  your readers in general) will be glad to have the explanation of an able
  Anglo-Saxon scholar and antiquary, the late lamented Mr. John Just of
  this town, whose merits as a philosopher and etymologist were highly
  appreciated by the learned societies in this district. It occurs in a
  paper read at a chapter of the Rosicrucians in Manchester a few months
  since:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Worth</span>.&mdash;<i>Weorthe</i>, Anglo-Saxon, a
  field, &amp;c. <i>Worth</i> means land, close, or farm. It does not
  necessarily imply any residence, although thereon might be a hall or
  mansion. It likewise sometimes means nothing more than road or public
  way. Hence it is connected with the names of many places on our old
  roads, as Ainsworth, Edgeworth, on the Roman military road to the north;
  Failsworth, Saddleworth, on the Roman military road from Manchester to
  York; Unsworth, Pilsworth, on the old road between Bury and Manchester;
  also Ashworth, Whitworth, Butterworth, on old roads, and connected with
  old places, near Rochdale. Whether originally land, closes, or farms,
  <i>worths</i> were acquired properties. The old expression of 'What is he
  worth?' in those days meant, 'Has he land? Possesses he real property?'
  If he had secured a <i>worth</i> to himself, he was called a
  <i>worthy</i> person, and in consequence had <i>worship</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
  due respect shown him. A <i>worth</i> was the reward of the free; and
  perchance the fundamentals of English freedom were primarily connected
  with such apparently trivial matters, and produced such a race of
  <i>worthies</i> as the proud Greeks and haughty Romans might not be
  ashamed of. <i>Worth</i> is pure Anglo-Saxon. The Scandinavians applied
  it not in their intercourse with our island."</p>

  ... i sentieri divengono più ardui ... in fondo, mezzo nascosto dal fitto
  fogliame apparisce ... un casolare; un villano lo invita ad entrare ... e
  gli parla in Inglese, in Francese, ed in Tedesco!... ci s' allontana
  impazientito, e corre più lunge!... I castagni divengono rari.... Aride
  roccie annunziano il vertice dell' Apennin. Ancora una breve salita, e
  poi ci sarà sul più alto pinacolo del Prato Fiorite. Ma al piè del
  viattolo è un inciampo! e l'occhio sconfortato scorge la livrea di un
  <i>groom</i> e da un lato una sentimentale <i>Lady</i>, che si è
  arrampiccata più lassa e prosaicamente seduta sulla sua sedia portatile
  sta scrivendo una lettera sopra un foglio a vignetta. L' Italiano
  continua ad ascendere ... e giunte alla vetta ... all' amplissima libera
  vista, il cuore dell' Italiano batte più forte ... la mente s' esalta, e
  i più energici pensieri vi bollono.... Ma gli occhi ritornano svegliati
  dei passi dei Cavalli, appiè del ripiane s' affaccia una numerosa
  comitiva ... è un <i>pique nique</i>! Fuggi fuggi mal capitate Italiano
  la straniero l' inseque anco nel nido dell aguila!"</p>

  <p><i>Canker or Brier Rose</i> (Vol. vii, p. 500.).&mdash;I suspect that
  this term refers to the beautiful mossy gall, so commonly seen on the
  branches of the wild rose, which has been called the <i>bedeguar</i> of
  the rose. This is the production of a cynips; and, from its vivid tints
  of crimson and green, might well pass at a short distance for a flower,
  brilliant, but scentless. Hence Shakspeare's allusion:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye</p>
      <p>As the perfumed tincture of the roses."</p>

  <p><i>Cancre</i> and <i>crabe</i> in French are synonymous, meaning the
  same; Anglicè, crab (<i>fish</i>).</p>

  <p>Now, we have crab-tree, a wild apple-tree; a canker rose, a wild rose;
  dog rose, dog-violet, horse leech, horse chestnut. In all these cases the
  prefix denotes inferiority of species.</p>

  <p><i>Door-head Inscriptions</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 23. 190.)&mdash;In
  Watson's <i>History of Halifax</i> (1775, 4to., p. 257.), in describing
  the High Sunderland, an ancient mansion near Halifax, formerly the
  residence of the Sunderlands, he notices that "over the north door is
  written, <i>Ne subeat Glis serdus</i>, a mistake for <i>surdus</i>; and
  over a door on the south side, <i>Ne entret amicus hirudo</i>."</p>

  <p>As some of your correspondents doubt as to the proper reading I have
  thought it worth while to give this duplicate version. I recollect the
  inscription well, having been sorely puzzled, when a schoolboy, in my
  frequent walks to High Sunderland, to understand these two inscriptions.
  I must not omit the inscription on the south front:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Omnipotens faxet, stirps Sunderlandia sedes</p>
      <p>Incolet has placide, et tueatur jura parentum,</p>
      <p>Lite vacans, donec fluctus formica marinos</p>
      <p>Ebibat et totum testudo perambulet orbem!"</p>
    </div>

  <p>"<i>Time and I</i>," &amp;c. (Vol. vii., p. 181.).&mdash;Who was the

  Mazarin (<i>History of England</i>, vol. ii. p. 100., small edition). Mr.
  Stirling (<i>Cloister Life of Charles V.</i>, p. 151., 2nd edition) tells
  us that it was a favourite adage of <!-- Page 586 --><span

  <p><i>Lowbell</i> (Vol. vii., p. 181.).&mdash;The inclosed was taken from
  the <i>Northampton Herald</i> of the 16th April, 1853:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"On Monday last this village was thrown into a state of great
  excitement by the tidings that a married labourer, named Samuel Peckover,
  had taken poison, with the intent of destroying himself. This was found
  to be the case. He had swallowed a dose of mercury, such as is commonly
  used for sheep, and, but for the timely arrival of Mr. Jones, surgeon,
  from Brackley, who administered him a powerful antidote, he would have
  expired within a short time. The circumstance which led the misguided man
  to attempt this rash act was as follows:&mdash;Although a married man,
  and wedded to a very respectable woman, he had seduced a young female of
  the village, named Adelaide Hirons, who was delivered of a female child
  on Saturday last. This disgraceful affair, of course, had become known to
  the neighbours, who expressed great indignation at his most disreputable
  conduct, and they in consequence determined to put him to open shame by
  'lowbelling' him in front of his cottage in the evening, when all the old
  pots and kettles in the village were put in requisition, and a continual
  discord was kept up for two or three hours, by way of administering him a
  wholesome punishment for his breaking the marriage vows. It is supposed
  that the fear of this impending disgrace, and also remorse for his crime,
  were the cause of his thus attempting to make away with himself, and to
  rush unprepared and unpardoned into the presence of his Maker!"</p>

  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2¼ per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

  <p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
  one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
  Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident
  Director.</p>
